# Face-detection
# 👀 Face Detection using OpenCV (Haar Cascade Classifier)

## 🧠 Overview

This project is a real-time face detection application built using Python and OpenCV. It utilizes a Haar cascade classifier to detect faces from a live webcam feed and displays bounding boxes around detected faces.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- Captures video through webcam
- Converts each frame to grayscale
- Uses Haar cascade classifier (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`) to detect faces
- Draws rectangles around detected faces in real-time

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- Haar Cascade Classifier (pretrained)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed  
2. Install OpenCV:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
